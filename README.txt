Course Registration Application (Project 4-CS 480)

This project is a course registration application developed in C#
and using the .NET core for SQL.

The application was developed to allow for a multi-user enviornment
so that multiple students could add/drop courses at the same time
without any issues.

The GUI was created using a windows forms app and each button was
coded with event driven programming in mind.
